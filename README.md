##Why develop this version?
Rocket. Chat Electron does not have Mac (Apple Silicon) version at present, so it has a poor use experience. After compiling the project with Electron 11, there is GC error in running, so no solution has been found for the time being.
The Rossta version has a lot of problems, in addition to the stuttering, memory leaks for a long time.
Provide an Electron 13 packaged web version for daily use.
